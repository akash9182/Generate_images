Install dependencies using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).

## Usage

Run `jupyter notebook` in terminal and the code will pop up in your browser. Install it [here](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) if you don't have it.

## Credits

Credits go to the [creator](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/variational_autoencoder.py) of Keras. I've merely created a wrapper to get people started.
